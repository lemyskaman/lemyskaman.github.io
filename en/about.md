A cyber-bohemian music lover, curious, maker, creative technician who plays a lot with electricity logic and many computers also addicted to a good coffee.

My birth certificate says that my name is Lemys Lopez, a Venezuelan in his mid-thirties, I stll can not discern if I develop systems to live, or if I live having fun developing systems.

I’ve created this site honestly as an archive to store everything i’ve learned and experienced things that sometimes one by unusingit tend to forget, like your grandma’s cookbook, and if you like her cookies why don't share the recipe to everyone
